# Embedded Service SDK for iOS Examples

_These sample apps demonstrate Service SDK features. They do not contain production-quality code and are not meant to be used in production apps._

## Instructions

To use an example app, drop the required framework files in the [Frameworks root directory](../Frameworks/) of this repo. You can get the framework files by downloading the iOS SDK from the [Embedded Service SDK Developer Center](https://developer.salesforce.com/developer-centers/service-cloud/sdk/).

## Sample Apps

* [Embedded Service SDK Hello World Example](./SnapinsSDKExample/): A simple Embedded Service SDK Hello World app that launches Knowledge, Cases, Chat, and SOS. This app uses the action button API to display a custom action button.
